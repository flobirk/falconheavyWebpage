          <h1> The Falcon Heavy</h1>
          <em>Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two.</em>
          <p> With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9.
            </p>
            <p>
            Its first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars.
          

<p>A Cast of Falcons

SpaceX routinely flies two versions of its Falcon 9 rocket, one to carry NASA cargo to the International Space Station and one to lift satellites into Earth orbit. A crewed version is being tested and could carry astronauts later this year.

The more powerful Falcon Heavy rocket lifted off for the first time in 2018.

A smaller rocket, Falcon 1, flew from 2006 to 2009.

<p> Falcon-9 is a liquid fueled orbital launch vehicle for medium to heavy sized missions, which is currently under development at SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corp.). It is techonologically based on the Falcon-1 launch vehicle. Both stages are Kerosene / LOX fueled.

    <p>The first stage, which will be reusable after recovery by powered landing, is to be powered by 9 of the SpaceX built Merlin-1C engines with regenerative cooling. The upper stage will use a single Merlin engine and will also be reusable. The Falcon-Heavy is offered with a 5.2 m fairing.
    
   <p> High inclination launches will launch from Vandenberg AFB. Launch site for low inclination launches is the former Shuttle pad at Cape Canaveral, LC-39A. An additional launch site at Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas, is also under construction.
    
    <p>The first flight for a Falcon-Heavy was originally planned for 2014 from Vandenberg, but has been moved to Cape Canaveral in 2015, eventually delayed to early 2018. All further Falcon Heavy flights are Falcon-Heavy (Block 5) versions.</p>
